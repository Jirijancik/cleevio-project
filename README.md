# Svg Icons were generated by:
npx @svgr/cli src/assets/icons/Flags/Flags --out-dir src/assets/icons --icon --typescript

# Tech Stack
* project uses React, Typescript, Redux, Router, Styled-Components, Storybook, React-Aria
* Project is build as SPA with layouts 

# For Datepicker used:
https://reactdatepicker.com/

# Components
* Most of the components has its own storybook for testing and developement purpouses
* In developpement of components used React-Aria https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/why.html for better web accesibility

# State of project
* project is unfortunatelly not finished, due to the lack of time, edit and delete actions are missing
* project is showing created trips only locally (saved in Redux store), 
* api for trips needs to be improved, fetched data lacks date, adress, and id parameters
* some changes from initial design were made, added more components where it made sence, 
* project uses <code>assets/cssVariables.css</code>. All spacings, collors, and sizes should be unified here (of created js file with css design tokens) 
* some files are still in <code>.js</code> due to lack of time... Main priority should be to add types and modify them into typescript files.
* all components be modified so they will use <code>Tooltips</code>
* there is a need to setup proper <code>Services</code> to communicate with rest Api
